# Regex-password-validator-python-edition-
 
When I was learning python, I thought it would be a good idea to replicate the Java regex password validator, into python, with few added extras.

Features:

- sound randomisation
- count recorded for every failed attempt 

Getting started:

In order to use the program, you would have install the following in your terminal:

 - pip3 install playsound
 https://pypi.org/project/playsound/ - website for reference
